# Process
This assignment was to create and code a quiz using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. This quiz I have created consists of 5 questions with a scoring system based on the time remaining. It featured a penalty system which deducted 15 seconds for each question that you get wrong. This score is then put into the local storage where it should show in the leaderboard. Unfortunately I was unable to get the leaderboard system of my quiz to work and it leaves the scores and initials in the local storage system.
